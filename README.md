# MonoTempo

Centralized stuff

# Tasks

- [X] Configure network automatically ( not quite there yet,
      solution is currently a workaround with netmon ).

## Next minor version

## IMPORTANT

- [ ] Diagnose/Fix impinj reader
- [ ] Reenvio ( Present first functioning draft )
      deadline: 14d

### In progress

- [ ] Hotspot
- [ ] Reenvio

### Assigned

- [ ] Install script
- [ ] Start container and stuff automatically at boot
- [ ] Configure impinj reader's time automatically <- FIXME
- [ ] Configure docker-compose.yml to the correct reader
- [ ] Get equipment checkpoint data.

## Per-topic

### Datemon

- [ ] Move all the logic from datemon to MyReader or Envio
      a shell script shouldn't be a container, nor should
      it deal with it's own syncronization.

### Outro

Nice font recommendation: Recursive mono.
