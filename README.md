# MonoTempo

Centralized stuff

# Tasks

- [ ] Configure network automatically ( not quite there yet,
      solution is currently a workaround with netmon ).

## Next minor version

## IMPORTANT

- [ ] Diagnose/Fix impinj reader
- [X] Exportar banco de dados na máquina local.

## Per-topic

### Datemon

- [X] Move all the logic from datemon to MyReader or Envio
      a shell script shouldn't be a container, nor should
      it deal with it's own syncronization.

### Outro

Nice font recommendation: Recursive mono.
